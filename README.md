english-to-katakana
=============

![](demo.png)

Chrome extension that replaces English words with Katakana based on Wiktionary data.

Based on [panicsteve's cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt).

Mostly doesn't work: please don't actually use this to learn a language; you'll have a bad time.

Made as a proof of concept based on [@FioraAeterna's tweet](https://twitter.com/FioraAeterna/status/1168367072545427456).
